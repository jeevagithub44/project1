steps:
note here i not included that much of input image (inside the data folder) for training the model to reduce the size of  project.
1.run the MODEL.PY for to generate the Model currency.h5(not necessary you can use predefined model currency.h5 also)
2.run the GUI.PY to get the final product.

for training model: learn about image agumentation for different types of image for training the model.

ABOUT GUI: 1.uploadimage-for to upload image inside the DATA folder for input image for model training.
           2.Training - on clicking this the model starts learning.
           3.Imagetesting- on clicking this we give sample input image ,it demonstrate how image is processed.
           4.videotesting- to give input directly form the live camera feed.

PRE REQUESTIES:

1.PYTHON 7.X
2.OPEN CV
3.TENSORFLOW FOR MODEL TRAINING
